## App Brainstorming 

Apple Music: I like the curated playlist, high-quality audio, and seamless song transitions.
TikTok: I like the community interactions(like the stitches and comments) and how the 'for you page' is personalized based on the user's interests.
Instagram: I like the reels and the explore feed. Similar to TikTok, it is personalized based on the user's interests.

The app, HerRide, is a rideshare service designed specifically for individuals who identify as women, prioritizing safety, comfort, and peace of mind. To ensure a secure experience, all drivers on the platform are women, and users must register with a government-issued ID to verify their identity. HerRide also includes a unique Campus Ride Share feature, ideal for college students and friends who want an added layer of security after a night out. This feature lets users share their trip in real-time with trusted contacts, allowing friends to see their location. If a user hasnâ€™t reached their destination within a set time, HerRide sends an automatic alert to their selected contacts, ensuring someone is always looking out for them. This combination of gender-specific service-verified user accounts and location-sharing safeguards creates a safer, more supportive rideshare experience.

## Notes

I have used Xcode before so I am quite comfortable with it but trying to put the label was challenging because I did not know I was suppose to drag it at first.
